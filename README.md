# NYT Solvers
A project to reveal the words I _should_ have found for the New York Times' _Letter Boxed_ and _Spelling Bee_ puzzles.

## Notes 
Unfortunately, the NYT reference dictionary is not publicly available, so these solutions will diverge somewhat from the official solutions. Moreover, the two-word solution to _Letter Boxed_ is often dependent on rather specific words (for example, the other day "hexahedron" was part of the official solution) that my dictionary doesn't include.

I'm also not well-versed in CORS policy right now, but there is theoretically a way to just fetch the boards from NYT directly (I can see the JSON representation of the boards in the browser inspector, but trying to `fetch` the page to scrape the data is causing me some headaches). If I'm sufficiently motivated I may try to solve this.
